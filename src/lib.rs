//! An attempt to collect several proposals of [rust-lang/wg-allocators](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators) into a
//! MVP.
//!
//! Changes regarding the current `Alloc` trait
//! -------------------------------------------
//!
//! - The first thing to notice is, that [`Alloc`] was renamed to [`AllocRef`] in order to show that they are typically
//!   implemented for a reference or smart pointer or ZST, not directly for the type that actually holds the allocatorâ€™s
//!   state.
//!
//!   Issue on WG repository: [rust-lang/wg-allocators#8](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/8)
//!
//! - [`AllocRef`] was split up into [`AllocRef`], [`DeallocRef`], and [`ReallocRef`] to make more flexible allocators
//!   possible.
//!
//!   Issue: [rust-lang/wg-allocators#9](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/9)
//!
//! - The allocators has to be associated with [`BuildAlloc`]. It is related to the allocator traits similar how
//!   [`BuildHasher`] is related to [`Hasher`]. Although the signatures are different, it makes an even more flexible
//!   allocator design possible.
//!
//!   Issue: [rust-lang/wg-allocators#12](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/12)
//!
//! - Added an associative error type to [`AllocRef`]. Besides adding the possibility of returning additional information on
//!   allocation failure, it's also possible to split the usage of the [`AllocRef`] into a fallible and an infallible case.
//!   Personally I think this is a pretty big deal, as kernel programmer can rely on allocation, which will never fail. If
//!   an allocation can fail, only a `try_*_in` method may be available. To maintain backwards compatibility, [`AbortAlloc`]
//!   was introduced. [`AbortAlloc`] wraps another allocator, but aborts on OOM thus `AbortAlloc<Global>` may be used as
//!   default allocator for [`Box`] or `Vec`. To realize this, [`AbortAlloc`] implements `AllocRef<Error=!>`.
//!
//!   Issue: [rust-lang/wg-allocators#23](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/23)
//!
//! - The new layout type [`NonZeroLayout`] was introduced. Currently, implementors of [`Alloc`] can chose to allow
//!   zero-sized allocation so in a generic context it's impossible to rely on this, so banning zero-sized allocation is a
//!   possible step to prevent this. This also removes `unsafe` from [`AllocRef::alloc`] and [`AllocRef::alloc_zeroed`], and
//!   unlocks the possibility to move the extension API like `alloc_array` into a separate trait.
//!
//!   Issue: [rust-lang/wg-allocators#16](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-allocators/issues/16)
